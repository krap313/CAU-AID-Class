# Usage
1. Run the script:
   '''bash
   python knn_iris_classifier.py
   '''
2. Enter the number of neighbors('k') when prompted.
3. View the model's accuracy and balanced accuracy in the console.
4. Input 'sepal.length' and 'petal.length' in the format _value1,value2_ to predict the iris species.

## Features
- Hyperparameter tuning for KNN (`k` selection).
- Model training and evaluation.
- Console-based user input for custom predictions.
- Performance metrics: Accuracy and Balanced Accuracy.
